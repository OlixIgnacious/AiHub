└── Projects/ <br> 
└── …        # Project notebooks, analysis, and reports<br> 

- **Dataset/**  
  Contains source data and cleaned datasets used across AI projects. Organize by dataset name or project domain. Suggested files include `.csv`, `.parquet`, or `.json`.

- **Projects/**  
  Project-specific work that references the data in `Dataset/`. This may include Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, presentation files, and results.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OlixIgnacious/AiHub.git
   cd AiHub
   ```

2.	Explore datasets
	Browse through the Dataset/ folder to review available datasets. Feel free to add more as your collection grows.

3.	Run project notebooks
Head into the Projects/ directory, open the relevant notebook (e.g., analysis.ipynb), and run the cells—usually after setting up your Python environment.

4.	Add a new project
	•	Place your dataset under Dataset/
	•	Create a new directory under Projects/ with:
	•	A notebook or script implementing your idea
	•	A README.md explaining the purpose, dependencies, and instructions.

Recommended Environment Setup

Use the following as a starting point:
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # Linux/Mac
.\.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
